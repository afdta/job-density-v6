<div class="metro-interactive" style="max-width:700px;margin:100px auto;">
    <p>The relationship between place and economy is constantly evolving, and continually shaping both the development and the decay of our communities. From the growth of industrial cities during the 19th century to the rise of auto-centric suburbs during the 20th, this changing relationship produced the varied patterns of concentration, dispersion, and racial and economic segregation that still largely characterize our cities, towns, and regions today.</p>


    <p>But these patterns aren’t static: Today’s digital revolution is benefiting some industries and workers over others, while altering the physical geography of our economy in ways we are just beginning to understand.</p>
    
    
    <p>This report aims to help leaders and local stakeholders understand how much, why, and where economic activity has been clustering and dispersing across and within 94 large metropolitan areas from 2004 to 2015—a period of dramatic urban and economic change. Specifically, it examines the changing trends in job density and how actual trends differed from those we would expect to see if prior patterns held true. These trends greatly varied across and within metro areas.</p>

    <div class="mi-links">
    <p>The full report and this accompanying interactive shed light on four key trends</p>
    <p class="meta-header meta-header-0"><a href="#group-seqs-1">Job density increased in metropolitan America</a></p>
    <p class="meta-header meta-header-1"><a href="#group-seqs-2">Job density trends varied among metropolitan areas</a></p>
    <p class="meta-header meta-header-2"><a href="#group-seqs-3">Job density trends varied within metropolitan areas</a></p>
    <p class="meta-header meta-header-3"><a href="#metro-dashboard">Job density trends in your metro area are distinct</a></p>
