      <p>The relationship between place and economy is constantly evolving, and continually shaping both the development and the decay of our communities. Indeed, from the growth of industrial cities during in the 19th century to the rise of auto-centric suburbs during the 20th, this changing relationship produced the varied patterns of concentration, dispersion, and racial and economic segregation that still largely characterize our cities, towns, and regions today.</p>

      <p>But these patterns aren’t static. New ideas and innovations are fostering the creation of products and services that increase productivity, improve our health and the environment, and raise overall standards of living. Today’s digital revolution is however benefiting some industries and workers over others—while altering the physical geography of our economy in ways we are just beginning to understand.</p>
        
      <p>Hence, this report aims to help leaders and local stakeholders understand how much, why, and where economic activity has been clustering and dispersing across and within 94 large metropolitan areas from 2004 to 2015—a period of dramatic urban and economic change. Specifically, we look into changing trends in job density and how actual trends are different from expected changes. These trends greatly vary across metro areas. Thus, we have dashboards to help you find trends for your own place. </p>
